Implemented value iteration algorithm, exactly as described in the book
"Reinforcement Learning" by Sutton and Barto, in Rust. No external libraries or
scripts were necessary.

Directory structure:
Cargo.toml      : used by Cargo for compiling (like Makefile)
planner.sh      : the required shell script
target          : directory that gets created on compiling
src             : Rust source files

Compiling:
$ cargo build --release

Requirements for building:
* Nightly build of Rust (see https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html)
